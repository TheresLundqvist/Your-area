## Agile Methodology
Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/TheresLundqvist/projects/3)


The 5 Epics listed below were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a label(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## UX

A visitor to Your Area would be someone who is most likely an adult who is interested in buying design interior products.  

## Design 

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the site is mainly white and dark grey. The colours chosen are neutral in order to showcase the Home Décor Products with minimal distraction. 

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/343a40-ffffff-f8f9fa-564592) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/your-area-coolors.png)

### Imagery

There is 13 static images on the site where 8 of them is located in the inspiration gallery. Three static images is located in the footer for the companies representated there. The rest is the custom logo image and the main image in the home page. The static images were downloaded from the pexels image library.

### Typography  

The Josefin Sans font is the main font used for the body of the website. This font was imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

- [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the main content.

- [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for the overlay of the main image on the home page.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Schema 

Two relational databases were used to create this site - during production SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version. Below is an image of how the database models relate to each other:

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database_schema.png)

## Security Features and Defensive Design
### User Authentication

I applied Django's Class-based-views; Django's LoginRequiredMixin to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure only superusers can edit/delete products.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error.

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. Stripe keys and wh secret are also stored in the env.py file. 

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

A mixture of short tail and long tail keywords were carefully considered for the site. Keyword research was performed by checking Google search results, looking at competitor's keywords and by utilising wordtracker.com. 

An initial list of topics and keywords generated can be seen below. This list was then refined based on relevance and authority.

The most relevant keywords have been added to the site's meta-keywords and meta-description. These keywords have also been carefully included in page titles, headings, site content, `<strong></strong>` tags, image alt attributes and anchor tag links across the site. 

 ![Keywords](documentation/seo-keywords.png)

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://your-area.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://your-area.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a Facebook business account page
![Facebook page](documentation/facebook-page-one.png)
![Facebook page](documentation/facebook-page-two.png)
![Facebook page](documentation/facebook-page-three.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporate a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in learning more. 

![Newsletter page](documentation/newsletter.png)

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://your-area.herokuapp.com).

	- This contains the user's **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**

#### Final AWS Setup

- If Heroku Config Vars has `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` still, this can be removed now, so that AWS will handle the static files.
- Back within **S3**, create a new folder called: `media`.
- Select any existing media images for your project to prepare them for being uploaded into the new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- No further settings are required, so click **Upload**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://your-area.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or Your-area
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:
- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheresLundqvist/Your-area) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/TheresLundqvist/Your-area.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheresLundqvist/Your-area)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/TheresLundqvist/projects/1)

The 5 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Labels. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a label(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution. The user stories were also added and worked on in project iterations with a set deadline through Github milestones, this project was conducted through a total of 4 iterations. The user stories not yet to be finnished were added to a project backlog(milestone).
  
## Design

The site has a very simple and clean design with a wintry color theme and good contrast.

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-112b3c-ffffff-5d646b) to generate my colour palette.

<img width="800" src="documentation/colour-scheme.png">  

The colour scheme of the site is mainly golden gate bridge-orange, dark blue and White. The colours chosen are wintry white and blue and with orange to give good contrast.

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility.

- **#E84610** used for primary highlights, icons and buttons.
- **#112B3C** used for brand, headings and hoover effects on buttons.
- **#FFFFF** used for backgrounds
- **#5D646B** used for footer text.

### Fonts

Josefin Sans is the main font used for the body of the website with the only exeption of using Tilt Neon for the sub heading in the main image caraousel. These fonts were imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

- [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=josefin+sans) was used for the body content.

- [Tilt Neon](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tilt+Neon?query=tilt+neon) was used for sub heading in main image caraousel.

### Icons

Icons from Font Awesome is used throughout the site, such as brand icon, search bar magnifying glass, star rating, social media icons and icons for heading in resort details.


- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### Imagery

A total of five static images is used for the website. Three static images is used for the main image caraousel. One is used as a placeholder image for the resorts if the user chooses not to upload a image/images for a resort. The last static image uploaded to the app is used for the about page. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded and stored in Cloudinary by admin when creating the individual resorts.  

## Wireframes

I've used [Miro](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/) to design my sites wireframes.

## Features

### Header

<img width="800" src="documentation/header.png">  

**Logo**  
A customised logo was created using Josefin Sans font in italic style with two arrow icon from Font Awesome. This logo is positioned in the top left of the navigation bar. The logo is linked to the home page for ease of navigation for the user.  
  
**Navigation**  
The navigation bar is present at the top of every page and includes all links to the various other pages. The More navigation link is a drop down menu which includes a view all link and the Contact and About pages. When the user has logged in, the login link changes to display log out instead, giving the user their logged in status.

### Footer

<img width="800" src="documentation/footer.png">  

The footer section includes links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube. Clicking the links in the footer opens a separate browser tab to avoid pulling the user away from the site.
  
### Home Page  
  
**Main Image Carousel**  
  
<img width="800" src="documentation/main-carousel.png">  
  
The home page includes a bootstrap image carousel that alternates thorugh three images with diffrent encouraging and telling texts about the ski resorts website and then a view all button which links to the resort cards to view all the resorts on the website.  

- Find the Ski Resort best suited for you - All resort listed in one place  
- Get inspired >> Go Skiing - See all the amenities for the resort
- Secure a great ski experience - Read customer experience and leave yours

**Resort cards**

<img width="800" src="documentation/resort-cards.png">  
  
The resort cards gives the user a glimpse over the diffrent resorts on the webiste. The user can preview the resort through a image, see a preview of the resort description and a read more button that takes the user to the full detailed resort page. The resort cards are intented to give the user the possibility to overview the diffrent resorts in a clean and organized way, get inspired and then let them decide which resort they want a more detailed view over. The resort rating counter is visable on the cards and in the full view, so that the user instantly can see which resort has the best rating. 

### Resort details page 
  
**Resort description**  
  
<img width="800" src="documentation/resortdetails-description.png">  
  
After the resort image a detailed description of the resort follows. It is a descriptive text that sums up the listed features of the resort. This textfield creates a more painted picture for the user. Underneath the description a bootstrap image carousel shuffles three images of the resort to give the user some inspiration and overview of the resort.
  
**Resort listed features**  
  
<img width="800" src="documentation/resortdetails-listed.png">  
  
This list is an overview of the resort amenities. The user can find useful information before their planned visit such as opening hours and prices. If a user is in need of a particular lift, they can find all lifting arrangements available for the resort in this listed view. This view is intended as a quick and clean way for the user to get an fast overview of the resort and what they offer.

**Rating and comments counter**  
  
<img width="800" src="documentation/rating-comment-symbols.png">  
  
The counters for rating and comments give the user a fast assessment of the resort. They can see how many likes and comments the resort has gotten from other users. Users can use the share icon to share the page and resort with others.  
  
**Comments**  
  
<img width="800" src="documentation/comments.png">  
  
All users can view all comments made by others, but only logged-in users can leave a comment. The comments are only visable after and if admin approves. The user receives a message notifying them that the comment is awaiting approval before being published.

**Rating** 

<img width="800" src="documentation/rating.png">  

Users can see the average rating for each resort in the preview cards but also in the full detailed view. Logged in users can leave rating along with a comment to better help others make a descision on which resort to visit next.


**Edit and delete comments**  

<img width="400" src="documentation/edit-delete-comment.png">  
  
<img width="400" src="documentation/edit-comment.png">  
  
<img width="400" src="documentation/delete-comment.png">  
  
All logged in users can edit and delete their own comments. The edit and delete links are only visable on the comments made my the logged in user. When user clicks on the edit link they will be redirected to a new edit page, the comment will disappear from the website after the edit until Admin approves of the edited comment.  


### About page  
  
<img width="800" src="documentation/aboutpage-screenshot.png">  
  
The about page gives the user a short background story about the website to the user. 

### Contact page  
  
<img width="400" src="documentation/contactpage-screenshot.png">  
  
The contact page gives the user the opportunity to contact the website with questions or other subjects surrounding the website.  

### Account pages  

Django allauth was installed and used to create the Sign up, Log in and Log out functionality. Success messages inform the user if they have logged in/ logged out successfully.

**Register**  

<img width="400" src="documentation/signup-page.png">  

**Sign in**

## Database Design

I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Django‚Äôs Class-Based Generic Views. Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.
In order to create resort to the webiste a custom resort model was required. The Comment model allows users to comment on resorts and the resort is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one resort. The contact model is non-relational model as it is only for the users to be able to communicate with the website's owner/admin. The rating model allows logged in users to leave a rating and therefore the resort and user fields are foreign keys given that user must be logged in and the rating can only be linked to one resort.

The diagram below details the database schema.

<img width="700" src="documentation/datamodels.png"> 

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://ski-resorts-locator.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: Ski-resorts).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `‚åò+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TheresLundqvist/Ski-resorts)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
